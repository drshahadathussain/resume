I have experiences in the areas of additive manufacturing (Selective Laser Melting/Laser Powder Bed Fusion) of TPMS structures of NiTi and vacuum induction melting of copper-based shape memory alloys. I have developed several translational skills such as information management, data analysis, teamwork & collaboration, negotiation skills, creative problem solving and project management.

•I am experienced in operating SEM JEOL, FEI Quanta 3D FIB and FEI Nova NanoSEM for SEI, BSE and EDS; 
 X-ray diffractometer: Bruker D2 and Rigaku MiniFlex ; Leica based optical microscopes. I have operated DSC (Mettler Toledo and Setaram make) for thermal analysis. Mechanical testing included tensile, compression and fatigue on Instron 5969 and 8872 type machines. Hot and cold rolling of metallic samples on two-roll mill machines. Heat treatment and quenching, metallography and etching of metals.

•I have undergone training in Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) in Engineering and Computing, organized by CITI Program. I have taken Environment, Health, Safety and Security (EHSS) courses and training vis-à-vis laboratories and experimental hazards.
